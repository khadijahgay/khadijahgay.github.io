			<h3>Answers to frequently asked questions:</h3><br><br>
		</section>
		<section>
			<p>If you have a question not listed here, email me at contact@khadijahgay.site or go to request a consultation and include your question in the message.</p><br>
			<strong>What services do you offer?</strong><br>
			<p>I offer website design, website development, website management, website advisement, app management, and app advisement services! You can go to my Services Page to order and pay for a service.</p><br>
			<strong>Can I design my own website?</strong><br>
			<p>Of course! I am a web developer first and foremost. If you want to design your look for your website, I can just make it look how you would like it. It's not required that I design it for you.</p><br>
			<strong>How do you create my website?</strong><br>
			<p>I can use a website builder such as Wordpress, Wix, Squarespace, Godaddy, Weebly, and more! I can also code your website from scratch using a combination of coding languages. Just include which builder you would like to use or state that you want it built from scratch when you request a consultation.</p><br>
			<strong>What is a website builder?</strong><br>
			<p>A website builder is an app or website that creates a website for you, rather than coding a website from scratch.</p><br>
			<strong>What coding languages do you know?</strong><br>
			<p>I know HTML, Java, CSS, Javascript, PHP, and SQL. I use all or a combination of these when I code your website.</p><br>
			<strong>What is the website building process like?</strong><br>
			<p>First, you request a consultation. Please include as many details as possible within your request, it will make the process faster.<br>
			After you request, I will respond within 2-3 business days. When I respond, we will do an interview. The interview process is me asking<br>
			questions to get a feel for what you would want your website to look like and how you want the website built. You will also have the opportunity to ask me any questions.<br>
			After the interview, I do a mock-up of your website and ask you to approve it. I will continue to make changes until you're happy with it. Once approved, <br>
			I will start making the website. After we complete the website, you will do a final review of it. As long as you're happy with the results, you or I will publish it,<br>
			depending on what package you wanted. If you aren't happy, we continue to make changes until you are.</p><br>
			<strong>How long does website building take?</strong><br>
			<p>It depends on how many pages you have on your site and how complex they are. A page is every section of the website that your clients can view.<br>
			If you have multiple pages, it will take longer. On average, it takes 3-7 days to make a page. Simple websites with 1-5 pages take around a month to complete. Contact me for a more specific estimate.</p><br>
			<strong>How many changes can I make to my website?</strong><br>
			<p>It depends on the package you select. I can manage your website for a fee monthly, or I can make the website and you handle the rest.<br>
			Changes depend on price, the more you pay, the more changes you can make per month. I understand it may not be ideal to have a limit,<br>
			but in order to ensure that your needs are met, I have to limit changes to effectively use my time.</p><br>
			<strong>Can you help me run my website?</strong><br>
			<p>Yes! I understand that not many have knowledge of website servers and document uploads. I do teach my clients how to use their apps for a fee,<br>
			manage the apps for you, or you can handle it yourself. It all depends on what you would like.</p><br>
			<strong>Do I have to pay to contact you?</strong><br>
			<p>Of course not. All consultations are free. It's easier to simply email me, but you can do that or request a consultation.<br>
			If you decide not to purchase a service from me, that is okay too. Although, I do hope I can meet your needs!</p><br>
